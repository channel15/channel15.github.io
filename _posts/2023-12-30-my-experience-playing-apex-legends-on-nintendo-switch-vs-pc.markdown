### **Nintendo Switch Portability Allows Me to Enjoy Apex Legends with Friends**
The COVID-19 pandemic limited how my friends and I could interact and game together online. With laptops struggling to run games smoothly, I was thrilled when Apex Legends released on Nintendo Switch, providing a portable option to continue playing together. While the Switch offered better performance for me than my aging laptop, transitioning fully to the portable platform also came with adjustments.

### **Initial Challenges with Switch Docked Gameplay**
Playing docked, I found myself struggling to hear my teammate's calls and footsteps over ambient noise. Like many modern multiplayer titles, situational awareness in Apex requires optimal audio. After some troubleshooting, I realized wireless headphones were the key to clearly hearing the action. This solved my docked issues, allowing full immersion regardless of screen size.
### **A Truly Portable Apex Experience on Switch** 
Once headphones allowed smooth docked play, I began taking full advantage of the Switch's mobility. Being untethered to play Apex during my commute or anywhere else spontaneously was incredible. No longer confined to one room, I could squad up virtually anywhere. The ability to pick up and continue matches on the go enriched my enjoyment of Apex's squad-based gameplay immensely. 
### **High-End PC Performance Leads to Cross-Progression Frustration**
Upgrading to a powerful gaming PC unlocked buttery-smooth frame rates in Apex at maximum settings. However, my excitement was dampened realizing I could not carry over my progression from Switch. Restarting from level one after dozens of hours felt discouraging. To continue playing with friends still on Switch, I started using Elgato to stream my PC session portably. 
### **Nintendo Franchises as a Welcome Compliment to Multiplatform Titles** 
While cross-platform play opens gaming communities, Nintendo consoles remain vital for acclaimed exclusive series like The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, and Animal Crossing. These iconic worlds are system sellers on their own merits. Having grown up with Nintendo, I find value owning a Switch to access beloved franchises unavailable anywhere else. 
### **Mobile Apex Matches Enhance Appreciation for Switch's Unique Hybrid Design**
Being able to enjoy the same full multiplayer experiences both docked and on-the-go adds tremendous value, engulfing me in matches wherever I am. The Switch's convertibility from home console to handheld is unmatched, allowing seamless transitions between screens. Carrying Apex matches between the TV and tablet empowers personalized playstyles that enrich my interactions within the game.
### **Continued Preference for Switch Despite PC Advantages**
While PC offers visual superiority and fluid keyboard/mouse controls, my primary system remains Nintendo Switch. Disappointing cross-progression blockade and preference for Switch's signature versatility outweigh performance benefits alone. Furthermore, I appreciate that Switch and PC gaming complement each other - one optimized for mobility, community, and Nintendo titles, the other maximizing fidelity and precision. Both have merits for varied player needs and budgets.
### **Fond Memories of Apex on All Platforms** 
In conclusion, my experience with Apex Legends across Nintendo Switch, PC, and in between illuminated strengths of each ecosystem. The Switch version enhances squad play through untethered mobility. PC raises thebar graphically. Regardless of hardware, the core squad-focused gunplay and progression I share with friends are what keep drawing me back into the Outlands time and time again. Both platforms have a place in my game library and memories with Apex Legends.
