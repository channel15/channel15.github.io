## Managing Primary PS4 Console Designation 
Sony allows each PSN account to designate one PS4 console as the "primary" console. This primary console allows all users to access downloaded digital games, add-ons and subscriptions without logging into their PSN account on that system. However, confusion can arise when attempting to share games between multiple PS4 consoles. Let's explore some common problems and their resolutions.
### Designating Your Current Console as Primary
To designate your PS4 as primary, go to **Settings > Users and Accounts > Activate as Your Primary PS4** and select **Activate**. This will register that specific console as your account's primary system, allowing other users on that PS4 to access your downloaded content. **It is important to note that only one console can be assigned as primary at a time.**

### Deactivating a Previous Primary Console 
If another PS4 was previously activated as primary, you must first deactivate that console on the **PlayStation web account management page**. From there, follow the steps above to activate your current PS4. You may also need to **restore licenses** in the Settings menu after changing the primary console in order to regain access to your games across devices. 
## Resolving Issues Caused by Unauthorized Primary Console Changes
Unfortunately, account credentials can sometimes be compromised without the owner's knowledge. This may unintentionally alter the designated primary PS4.
### Changing Passwords After Unauthorized Sign-ins
If you notice unexpected sign-ins on your account, immediately change your password on the account management site to secure your information. Unknown parties accessing your profile could inadvertently deactivate game sharing on your intended primary console. 
### Restoring Access to Downloads 
Check that your primary PS4 activation was not altered if you suddenly lose access to downloaded games, add-ons or subscriptions. Deactivate all other consoles as primary, then re-designate your own as outlined above. **Additionally, restoring licenses from the Settings menu may help refresh licensing permissions across devices.**
## Contacting PlayStation Support for Assistance
In some persistence cases, troubleshooting solutions like deactivating unauthorized primary consoles and restoring licenses may not resolve game sharing disturbances. If those methods fail, contact **PlayStation Support for personalized assistance assessing your account status**. Provide details of the issue encountered, steps already attempted, your console and region information to qualified representatives. Their internal tools can help diagnose the root cause and point you towards a remedy.
## Preventing Further Account Compromise
While problem-solving existing sharing problems, also take prudent precautions moving forward:
### Using Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication 
Choose a long, randomized password not used elsewhere and enable two-factor authentication via the PSN mobile application for additional layer of security when signing in. 
### Monitoring for Unrecognized Sign-ins
Regularly check the sign-in history on the account management webpage. Be on alert for any unfamiliar locations not matching your primary consoles. Unrecognized activity could indicate compromised login credentials needing an immediate password reset.
## Maintaining Save Data Backups
To avoid potential loss of game progress during outages, consider periodically uploading saves to **PS Plus Cloud Storage**. This allows restoring character data if primary console assignments inadvertently change due to unauthorized changes or troubleshooting steps require erasing local storage.  
## In Summary
Sony's **game sharing functionality provides great value when utilized correctly**. However, unintended alterations like compromised login credentials or unknown primary console designations can disrupt access. Applying the countermeasures in this guide – from re-configuring primary activations to contacting support for account verification – helps troubleshoot sharing glitches and reduce vulnerability to unauthorized access moving forward. Always practice safe online habits to maintain full control of your PSN profile and digital library.
