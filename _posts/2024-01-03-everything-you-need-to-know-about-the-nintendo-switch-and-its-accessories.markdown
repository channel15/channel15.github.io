### What Comes Included Right Out of the Box
The Nintendo Switch comes packaged with the essential components needed for both portable and console gaming. In the box, users will find the main Switch console, a pair of detachable **Joy-Con controllers**, two **Joy-Con wrist straps**, the Nintendo Switch dock, a **Joy-Con Grip accessory**, and the necessary power adapter and HDMI cables. This all-inclusive packaging provides a full gaming experience straight out of the box, whether playing on the go in handheld mode or connected to the TV at home via the dock.

### The Versatile Joy-Con Controllers 
At the heart of the Nintendo Switch's flexibility are the innovative **Joy-Con controllers**. These **detachable controllers** can attach directly to the console's sides when playing in handheld mode or be used separately for multiplayer sessions. They also snap into the included **Joy-Con Grip accessory** to create a more traditional gamepad for use with the dock and TV. Additionally, Nintendo offers optional **Pro Controllers** for those who prefer a larger controller body. The system's versatile control options allow players to choose their preferred method of play.
### Seamless Transition Between Handheld and TV Modes
With its 6.2-inch capacitive multi-touch screen, the Nintendo Switch functions as both a fully-featured portable gaming system as well as a home console. Users have the ability to pause gameplay on the go, then seamlessly pick up right where they left off at home on the big screen via the dock. This unique hybrid design delivers an unmatched level of flexibility, allowing players to enjoy their favorite games whenever and wherever they like. 
### The More Affordable Nintendo Switch Lite
In fall 2019, Nintendo launched a more budget-friendly dedicated handheld version called the Nintendo Switch Lite. Featuring integrated controls rather than detachable **Joy-Cons**, this model does not support output to a TV or tabletop play like the original Switch. However, it provides full access to the expansive library of Switch games at a lower price point, making it perfect for purely portable play.
### Expand Storage with a microSD Card
With only 32GB of built-in internal storage, the Switch does not provide much space for digital game downloads and installs out of the box. Thankfully, the console supports removable microSD storage expansion of up to 2TB, allowing players to keep their entire game libraries installed and avoid long waits for partial downloads. Larger capacity **microSD cards** enable housing entire game collections on the Switch for truly portable gaming.
### A Wide Range of Fun and Useful Accessories  
Nintendo and third parties offer no shortage of officially licensed Switch accessories that enhance the overall experience. Some popular options include additional pairs of **Joy-Con controllers**, Pro Controllers for a more traditional feel, hard and soft cases for transportation and protection, screen protectors, stands for tabletop play, and docking stations. Third party brands additionally provide solutions like battery packs to prolong portable session lengths and accessories enabling the use of other controllers.
### Expand Controller Compatibility and Multiplayer Options
While the versatile **Joy-Con controllers** fulfill most core gaming needs, the Nintendo Switch also supports a variety of other input methods. The more traditional Pro Controller provides a familiar layout for those preferring a full-sized gamepad. Additionally, with the help of adapters, the system recognizes controllers from other Nintendo consoles like the **GameCube controller**. These expanded controller options further unlock local multiplayer functionality and accommodate differing play styles. 
### Online Play and On-The-Go Connectivity 
A paid Nintendo Switch Online membership grants access to online multiplayer gaming acrosssupported titles, a library of classic NES and SNES games with added features, exclusive offers and more. It also enables novel play possibilities like multiple Switches seamlessly sharing games via online functionality. The versatility of its online capabilities further strengthens the Switch's status as the perfect all-in-one device for both solo and social gaming scenarios anytime, anywhere.
### A Vast and Ever-Growing Library
Since launching in 2017, the library of Nintendo Switch and partner studio games has expanded tremendously. First-party Nintendo franchises like Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Animal Crossing take full advantage of the system's hybrid features. Meanwhile, robust third-party support ensures availability of series like Dragon Ball FighterZ, Diablo III, and Fortnite for both portable and console play. Consistent firmware system and feature updates also breathe new life into titles. With such a wide array of games ranging from indies to blockbusters, Switch owners will stay entertained for years to come.
