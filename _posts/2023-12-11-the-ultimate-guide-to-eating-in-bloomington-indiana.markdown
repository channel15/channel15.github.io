### Chinese Dining
For traditional Chinese cuisine, **Fortune Cookies Chinese Restaurant** stands out. They offer all the staples done exceptionally well from appetizers like eggrolls and potstickers to mains like sesame chicken, Kung Pao shrimp, and mandarin beef. **Great Wall Chinese & Asian Buffet** is a good option if you're in the mood for variety. Their lunch and dinner buffets have over 100 items to choose from, including made-to-order entrees, sushi, and a carving station.
### Steakhouse Selections  
For tender, flavorful steaks, **Janko's Little Zagreb Steakhouse** cuts above the rest. Their seasoned steaks are cooked to perfection, with cuts like New York strip, ribeye, and filet mignon featuring thick, juicy cuts. Sumptuous sides like garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach round out the meal. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide views of scenic Lake Monroe too. Janko's is especially popular with IU sports coaches entertaining recruits.
### Seafood Specialties
While options are more limited than in coastal cities, **Red Lobster** satisfies seafood cravings with a wide selection of fish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. Their hot Crab Digits appetizer and Parmesan-encrusted Tilapia are top sellers. You'll find fresh catches expertly prepared in dishes from around the world.
### Pub Grub Favorites 
For casual fare and craft beers, head to **Crazy Horse**. Order a flight of locally brewed IPAs to accompany their menu of flatbreads, salads, sandwiches and shareables like Fried Mac n' Cheese Bites. Another reliable choice is their Fried Portabella Mushroom appetizer.
### Iconic Burgers
Only the brave should attempt eating an entire **Big Ugly Burger** from **Bub's Burgers & Ice Cream**. Tipping the scales at 1 pound before cooking, this monstrous patty is stacked high with savory toppings between a tender, toasted bun. Conquering one lands your picture on their Wall of Fame. Their Seasoned Fries and rich milkshakes are also fan favorites. 
### Creative Calzones  
For Italy-inspired comfort food and daily specials, **Louis D'Angelo's Pizzeria** satisfies. Their calzones are filled with generous portions of mozzarella, ricotta, and meat or veggie fillings. The **B-Town Biggie Calzone** is a local legend, enough to feed 2-3 people for just $8 on Thursdays. With authentic brick oven crusts and made-from-scratch sauces, it's hard to go wrong here.
### Iconic Pizza Joints
Pizza lovers flock to **Mother Bear's Pizzeria** for creative signature pies. Their popular **Cosmo Pizza** layers cured meats, caramelized onions, and sweet peppers atop a tangy sauce. Get a large for great value since the crust-to-topping ratio is significantly better than smaller sizes. Another consistent favorite is **Yogi's Pizza Pub** for their thin-crust pizzas, vast beer selection, and lively game day environment.
### Irish Cuisine and Whiskey 
A standout for unique dishes and ambiance is **The Irish Lion Pub & Restaurant**. Authentic Irish fare like Bangers and Mash, Fish and Chips, and Shepherd's Pie fill the menu alongside classic American plates. With over 120 types of whiskey on the extensive menu and live music most nights, it's an experience unto itself. The cozy pub atmosphere enhances the flavor of every bite.  
### Southern Breakfast Bites
For hearty morning meals made with care, head to **Wee Willy's Family Restaurant**. Homemade biscuits, grits, and fluffy pancakes hit the spot, along with omelets filled with your choice of meat, cheese and veggies. Staples like fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and collard greens also satisfy at affordable prices. It's a true slice of Midwestern comfort food.
### Seasonal, Local Flavors
For inventive handcrafted meals and a memorable culinary experience, chef Daniel Orr's **FARMbloomington** stands alone. Using ingredients sourced from local farms and artisans, seasonal menus pair unexpected yet balanced flavors. Dishes constantly push boundaries while remaining approachable. Their brunch offerings are also worth the trip, like savory Bacon and Egg Pizza or delicate Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Cozy rustic decor and gracious service complete the picture of farm-to-table excellence.
### Coffee Shop Ambiance  
For java, baked goods and a youthful atmosphere, nothing matches **Runcible Spoon Restaurant & Bakery**. Sip a latte or seasonal craft cider while enjoying Eggs Benny, Belgian Waffles or snacks like Scallion Cheddar Scones. Sit at communal tables and you may find yourself next to artists, academics or celebrities alike - owner Janet Taylor frequently plays host. Creative specials also pop up on the seasonal menu, always prepared with care using local sourcing when available.
### Cajun Creole Comforts 
Satisfy cravings for New Orleans-inspired flavors at **Uptown Cafe**. Tender Jambalaya, Etouffee stew or Po' Boys stuffed with fried shrimp or catfish. Wash it down with Craft Beer, Hurricanes or Mint Juleps. The laidback ambiance feels straight out of the French Quarter. Colorful decor and cuisine delivered with southern hospitality make any visit memorable. Whether you come for lunch or dinner, leave ready for a second helping.
### Upscale Fare Worth the Splurge  
Premium cuts and impeccable service set **Scholars' Inn Restaurant** apart as Bloomington's romantic fine dining establishment. Seared scallops, steak frites, and pan seared duck breast entice tastebuds alongside a globally-inspired wine list. While pricier than casual spots, the experience is elevated and memorable for special occasions. Reserve ahead especially for their popular Sunday brunch buffet. Scholars' Inn raises the bar for what great meals in Bloomington can be.
