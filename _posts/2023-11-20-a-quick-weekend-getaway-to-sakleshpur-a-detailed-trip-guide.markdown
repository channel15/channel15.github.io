## Bisle Ghat Viewpoint - A Scenic Start 
We decided to take a quick weekend trip to Sakleshpur to escape from the busy city life. On Friday evening, we left Bengaluru around 3 am to reach Sakleshpur by early morning. The 5.5 hour journey took a bit longer than expected due to the rough road conditions through Bisle Ghat. **Bisle Ghat is one of the important elephant corridors in India** and locals often spot wild elephants crossing the area, though we didn't see any that day. We reached the scenic Bisle Ghat viewpoint by 8:30 am. It was worth the tiring drive just to see the stunning views of three mountain ranges - Kumara Parvatha, Pushpagiri and Patla Betta spread across the horizon. 
## Exploring Patla Betta Hill
After a refreshing breakfast, we headed to **Patla Betta**, another popular viewpoint around 8km away. Driving farther on the bumpy roads wasn't possible, so we parked the vehicle and hired a jeep to take us uphill. Reaching the peak by 11 am, we enjoyed the pleasantly cool weather under thick clouds. Sitting quietly with majestic vistas all around was pure bliss after hectic city life. Unwilling to leave, we spent around 15 minutes there before moving on with heavy hearts.
## Adventures at Wild Valley Resort 
Searching resorts online, **Wild Valley Aclat Meadows** stood out for its fantastic location, amenities and variety of **adventure activities**. Reaching by 1:30 pm, we were warmly welcomed and headed straight to the delicious hot lunch. After a relaxing rest at the riverside tents, evening arrived with tea and exploring the resort premises. We participated in treetop adventures like **sky cycling, ziplining and burma bridge**. By the bonfire in the evenings, conversations and smiles flowed as naturally as the music. The tasty buffet dinner was another highlight. 
## Mookanana Abbi Falls - A Forest Gem
Next morning, we checked out at 7 am to explore nearby attractions before our return journey. **Mookanana Abbi Falls** was a delightful surprise, hidden deep inside lush rainforests just 12km away. Finding it wasn't easy but with local guidance, we were rewarded with its serene beauty.
## History at Manjarabad Fort
From there, we visited **Manjarabad Fort** dating back to Tipu Sultan's era. Wandering through its ruins and learning about its intricate eight-pointed design was very interesting. After a filling lunch, we unfortunately had to start our journey back to Bengaluru, reaching home by 8 pm, tired but thoroughly satisfied with our quick weekend in nature.
## Overall Impressions and Recommendations
Sakleshpur offers far more than just ubiquitous coffee and spice plantations. Other must-visit attractions include **Sakleshwara Temple, Agni Gudda Hill, Pandavar Gudda, Hadlu Waterfall** and nearby historical sites. We stayed at a comfortable homestay very close to the highlights which was extremely convenient. While two days may seem short, it is perfectly possible to experience Sakleshpur's highlights at a relaxed pace. I would highly recommend adding this offbeat destination to your weekend itinerary if you seek scenic beauty, history and wilderness.
