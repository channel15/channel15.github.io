Setting up remote play on your PS4 allows you to stream and play your favorite PS4 games from almost anywhere using supported mobile devices and computers. Remote play provides you with the **freedom to game on the go** and continue your adventures even when you're away from home. In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know to get remote play up and running smoothly, including system requirements, the setup process, and tips for the best gameplay experience.
### Setting Up Your PS4 for Remote Play
To use remote play, your PS4 must first be configured to allow connections from other devices. Connect your DualShock 4 controller to your PS4 using a USB cable and power on the console. Then navigate to **Settings > Remote Play Connection Settings** and enable both "Allow Remote Play" and "Suspend Screen Saver" options. This will ensure your PS4 remains powered on and available when initializing remote play sessions. Also make sure to enable the "Wake Up from Rest Mode" option under **Settings > Power Saving Settings** so remote devices can wake your console remotely. Once completed, place your PS4 into Rest Mode by selecting "Rest Mode" from the power options menu. This puts the console in a low power state while still allowing remote connections.

### Downloading the Remote Play App
With your PS4 setup complete, it's time to download the PlayStation Remote Play app. The app is available free on both iOS and Android mobile devices as well as Windows and Mac computers. Search for "PlayStation Remote Play" in your device's app store and install the appropriate version. Once installed, open the app and follow the on-screen instructions to connect to your PS4 via its IP address or PlayStation Network sign-in. If your devices are on the same local network, remote play should detect and connect to your PS4 automatically.
### Tips for the Best Remote Play Experience
While remote play lets you enjoy your PS4 games from afar, factors like connection speed and quality can impact the gameplay experience. For the smoothest remote play sessions we recommend:
- Using a **5GHz WiFi connection** over 2.4GHz for higher bandwidth and lower latency. A direct ethernet connection to your router is ideal. 
- Playing on the **same home network as your PS4** whenever possible to avoid outside internet latency. 
- Testing remote play on **less demanding or reaction-based games** initially, as increased latency may hamper gameplay in fast-paced titles. 
- Avoid using remote play over **public, crowded, or otherwise unstable networks** which can cause lag, dropped frames, and visual compression artifacts.
- Use a stable **power source for your mobile device** to prevent interruptions from low battery life mid-session.
With the right setup and networks, remote play delivers an impressive way to continue enjoying your PS4 games wherever you may be. Just be aware that performance will vary based on your connection speed and quality.
### Advanced Remote Play Tips and Tricks
Once you've gotten familiar with the basics of remote play, there are some additional settings and tools you may want to explore to further enhance your experience.
The remote play app supports **controllers** via both Bluetooth and USB connections for a more traditional console-like feel away from home. Experiment with different touchscreen control layouts in the app settings as well. 
You can adjust screen refresh rate, resolution, and other performance settings within the remote play app to find the ideal balance of quality versus responsiveness for your connection speed. 
Certain games also allow syncing save data between local and remote sessions via cloud backup. Be sure to upload your latest saves to PlayStation Plus online storage before starting a remote play session to avoid any issues.
If you have multiple capable devices, use the remote play "Second Screen" feature to display overlays, maps, and other UI elements on a separate tablet or phone for a unique dual-screen experience.
With a little practice, remote play quickly feels like a full-fledged way to game from anywhere. So take advantage of these extra tips to maximize your remotely streamed PlayStation adventures.
### Alternatives for Remote Game Streaming
While remote play on PS4 is a handy built-in option, there are several other services and devices that offer competitive remote gaming experiences as well. Two particularly notable options include:
Google Stadia allows playing supported games in resolutions up to 4K by streaming game sessions from Google's servers. This removes console hardware requirements and relies solely on internet connections instead. Stadia promises industry-leading latency performance thanks to their powerful data centers and server infrastructure backend. 
NVIDIA GeForce Now functions very similarly to Stadia but lets you stream games you already own from supported digital stores like Steam. It utilizes NVIDIA's GPU rendering at their server farms and transmits H.264 video back to phones, tablets, and PCs. Both services deliver high quality, low-lag remote gameplay that some find preferable over console streaming alternatives.
As remote play and cloud gaming technologies continue advancing, gamers have more choices than ever for experiencing their favorite titles from any screen. While each service has pros and cons, competition in this space will ultimately benefit players the most going forward.
### Final Thoughts on Remote Gaming From Your PS4  
Remote play breathing new life into the games you already own for your PS4. With a little setup and tinkering, it offers a genuinely impressive remote gaming experience that lets you continue the adventure wherever you happen to be. Just be mindful of factors like network speed and expect some concessions versus local console play due to added latency from streaming. Remotely enjoying your PlayStation library from other devices is very much achievable though with reasonable expectations set. So take the plunge and give PS4 remote play a try - you just may find it surprisingly enhances your ability to game on the go.
