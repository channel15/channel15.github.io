### Maximizing Storage Performance for All Your Computing Needs
Solid state drives (SSDs) offer faster read/write speeds and greater shock resistance compared to traditional hard disk drives. However, choosing between internal and external SSD storage options requires considering factors like interface speeds, drive performance capabilities, and longevity needs. This in-depth guide will compare the pros and cons of both internal and external SSD solutions to help you pick the best fits for optimizing storage performance.

## Comparing Connection Interface Speeds 
Connection interfaces like USB, Thunderbolt, and SATA determine the maximum throughput between an SSD and host system. Older interfaces bottlenecks faster drives while newer ones unleash greater potential. 
### USB Interface Speed Guide
USB remains ubiquitous but speeds vary widely. **USB 2.0 interfaces cap at just 60MB/s**, rendering them suitable only for slower external HDDs and SSDs. Most computers now feature USB 3.0/3.1 with up to **5Gbps/10Gbps theoretical maximum bandwidth**. However, practical throughputs approach only 450MB/s-550MB/s depending on drive capabilities and other factors. USB-C brings reversible connectors to USB 3.1 Gen 2's 10Gbps spec, nearing external SATA 6Gbps performance.
### Thunderbolt 3's Speed Leadership 
At its best, Thunderbolt 3 boasts transfer rates up to **40Gbps**, nearly ten times faster than USB 3.1 Gen 2. This allows unleashing the full potential of NVMe SSDs externally. Thunderbolt 3 also supports DisplayPort and Thunderbolt device daisy-chaining, making it popular among creative professionals needing high-speed storage and multiple displays. Its overhead remains minuscule, allowing sequential reads reaching up to 3GB/s in ideal conditions.
## Considering Drive Performance 
With faster interfaces emerged high-speed internal and external SSD options. Performance varies based on drive technology and form factor.
### SATA SSD Speeds vs NVMe Performance 
Traditional 2.5-inch SATA SSDs max out at **around 550MB/s sequential reads** as the SATA interface caps at 6Gbps. M.2 NVMe PCIe SSDs bypass SATA, using multiple PCIe lanes for over **3,500MB/s sequential reads** and 3,000MB/s writes on high-end models. While external SATA and USB 3.1 SSDs can match 6Gb/s SATA speeds, only Thunderbolt 3 unleashes the full dominance of NVMe SSDs outside the system case.
### Thermal Effects on External SSD Speeds
Externally, faster SSDs push technological boundaries to achieve higher performance. However, heat buildup hinders consistent max speeds for prolonged periods. Well-built external enclosures with proper cooling via heat sinks and fans help sustain peak performance across all interface options. Look for enclosures rated to handle NVMe drives seeking best external throughput without thermal throttling. 
### Optimizing External Drive Performance
Carefully matching fast **NVMe internal SSDs with Thunderbolt 3** or even USB-C external drives maximizes the benefits of both worlds by leveraging the full potential of each storage medium's interface capabilities. Thunderbolt 3 enclosures with native NVMe support achieve sequential transfer rates within 20% of equivalent internal SSD speeds.
## Considering Drive Longevity Factors
While storage capacity demands grow exponentially, longevity remains a critical selection criterion as frequent data transfers raise wear and tear concerns over drives' usable lifespan. 
### Mitigating Wear with Modern SSD Controllers
Contemporary SSD controllers integrate wear-leveling, bad block management and over-provisioning techniques to distribute writes evenly across flash cells, fixing bad blocks automatically and preserving unused flash space respectively. These help **extend SSD lifespan beyond most users' storage needs even with regular data movements.** 
### Enhancing Endurance for Removable External SSDs  
Subject to more wear than stationary internal SSDs due to frequent connect/disconnect cycles, **choosing external drives with higher terabyte written (TBW) endurance ratings becomes prudent.** Look for enterprise-grade drives rated a minimum of 1,000 TBW for enterprise workloads involving large, regular file transfers over the years instead of consumer-grade less than 200TBW models. Well-engineered enclosures aid in longevity by preventing damage via shock/falls too.
## Expanding and Augmenting Storage Needs 
With larger application install sizes, 4K/8K video editing and more, demand for high-speed storage keeps growing while available drive bays stay limited. External SSD solutions help resolve such capacity and connectivity constraints cost-effectively.
### Supplementing Full Internal Bays Affordably
When out of internal M.2/SATA bays, **external SSDs provide affordable capacity boosts without sacrificing much performance.** Prices are comparable to internal drives yet add flexibility of not requiring open case access. Moving less used data externally also optimizes internal bay usage. 
### Gaining Portable Additional Storage
Laptop/desktop users gain portable high-speed storage pools through Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C SSD solutions for **easily transferring large files between systems.** Content creators stay productive on location with entire projects and assets library at hand. Students/professionals benefit from easily porting coursework/projects between personal and academic systems.
## Choosing the Optimal Storage Solution
To summarize, weighing drive performance capabilities, interface options, cost, portability needs and longevity requirements helps determine the best storage choice:
- **Fast internal NVMe SSDs** coupled with high-speed **external Thunderbolt 3 or USB 3.1 SSDs balance top performance and portable flexibility.**
- When portable drives suffer faster degradation, consider **enterprise-grade external SSDs** for intensive removable storage use cases. 
- **Slower SATA SSDs still serve well for most users internally or through USB 3.0 externally** without bottlenecks. 
- **Expanding limited bays affordable via high-capacity external SSDs** enables mixing optimized internal drives with portable additional storage.
Proper interface, drive and enclosure pairing optimizes both sides' full speed potential for maximizing storage experience across all computing scenarios.
