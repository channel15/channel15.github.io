##  Initial Skepticism of a New Platform
###**Getting Over My Initial Doubts of Turing's Legitimacy**  
When I first heard about Turing from a friend, I was immediately skeptical of trying a new remote job platform I had never heard of before. Their website seemed a bit bare bones and was slow to load, which didn't inspire much confidence in their operations. As someone accustomed to more established platforms, the unknown factors of Turing made me hesitant to invest my time pursuing opportunities there. However, my friend assured me Turing was a legitimate company helping connect skilled engineers to great remote work. So I decided to look past my initial doubts and learn more.

###**Doubts About Required Screening and Challenges**
My skepticism was furthered by Turing's requirements of completing technical screening tests and coding challenges as part of the application process. As a senior engineer with years of commercial experience, I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of spending hours doing assessments just for the chance to maybe get work. I would have much preferred spending my valuable time directly billing clients and earning money. The testing requirements also gave me doubts that Turing actually evaluated candidates in a meaningful way and wasn't just a platform focused more on screening volume over quality.
##  The Application and Screening Journey  
###**Automated Technical Screening Tests**  
My first step was completing Turing's automated technical screening which involved selecting various technologies I was proficient in like Python, Django, and JavaScript. I then took skills tests for each covering a range of concepts from data structures and algorithms to specific language features. The screening tests took a few hours total but provided a good baseline evaluation of my skills.
###**My First Live Coding Challenge**
One week after passing the automated tests, I had my first live coding challenge with a Turing engineer. The 30-minute video call involved answering questions about my experience while also solving a coding problem on a shared coding platform. It was nice getting to interact directly with someone from Turing to discuss the role and process further. The live coding experience helped validate my skills in a more personally engaging way than automated tests alone.
###**A More In-Depth Technical Screening**  
A few days later I had another hour-long technical screening where I solved another coding challenge and answered even more details questions testing my knowledge. This further validated my skills for Turing and showcased my communication abilities. The multi-step screening process may have seemed lengthy but did a thorough job evaluating candidates to ensure only the best engineers were connected to clients.
###**Surprising Swift Job Offer**
I was pleasantly surprised that after just two weeks going through Turing'sapplication process, I received an exciting job opportunity to work on an iOS app project. The swift offer highlighted for me that Turing aimed to efficiently move qualified candidates into work opportunities.
##  Starting Work at Turing
###**Relaxing Work Environment free from Delivery Pressure**
Beginning my first project, I was struck by how relaxed the work environment felt compared to past client engagements. Being a contractor through Turing meant I didn't have direct responsibility or pressure to ensure project deadlines and deliverables were met. This allowed me to purely focus my energy on coding and architecture without distraction. 
###**Reliable Payment Processing from Turing**
I was also impressed that Turing paid contractors reliably according to the hours worked over each two-week period. Coming from a history of occasional client payment delays, it was reassuring to know getting paid on schedule through Turing wasn't an issue. Their payment handling gave contractors stability usually lacking in full-time remote work.
###**Learning from Other Talented Engineers**  
Working on the iOS project, I got exposure collaborating with other very skilled engineers from all over the world. Our daily standups and design discussions allowed us each to learn from one another's areas of expertise. The chance to work alongside and learn from top global engineers has proven incredibly valuable for advancing my career.
##  Contractor Perspective on Pros and Cons  
###**Access to High Paying US Jobs Worldwide**
One major benefit of platforms like Turing is they allow skilled engineers globally to access high paying jobs in the US market they otherwise may not get exposure to. As someone living in a lower cost country, being able to work long-term on US projects through Turing has provided a great income boost.
###**Freedom from US Taxes as an Overseas Contractor** 
In addition, as a non-resident foreign contractor, I don't have to pay US taxes on the earnings from my Turing projects. This tax benefit provides even greater salary upside compared to working direct with a US company while living abroad. The tax exemption is an important contractor perk not to overlook when considering remote platforms.
###**Contract Limitations vs Full-Time Employment**
However, some downsides exist to contractor roles versus permanent employment. Platforms like Turing don't offer benefits like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement matching. Some job security and stability is also lost compared to a traditional full-time role. Contractors also need to balance platform work with finding other clients as jobs eventually end.
###**Coordination Challenges from Timezone Differences**
Being in a different country than my US clients meant daily standups, meetings, and reviews often occurred very late my local time. While doable, regularly working until midnight added fatigue over time. Proper planning to minimize after-hours meetings became important for sustainability.
##  My Experience as a Turing Contractor
###**Earning a Competitive Income in my Local Currency**  
Thanks to Turing's US rates, I earned a very good salary working on the iOS project even when paid in my local currency. With costs of living much lower where I reside, my take-home pay still went much further than it would have in America. The high salary potential globally is a huge win for skilled engineers.
###**Burnout from Adjusting to Late Work Hours**
However, over several months the regular overnight hours did start wearing me down more than I expected. Social plans with friends often conflicted with standup meetings leaving little personal time. It became challenging sustaining energy levels while staying up until 1-2am regularly. Burnout became a serious risk I had to monitor closely. 
###**Difficulty Balancing Turing with Full-Time Role**  
In addition, I was still employed full-time at another company during my Turing contract work. Juggling both roles became nearly impossible to manage well as hours piled on. Something ultimately had to give, so I made the tough choice to step back from Turing to refocus fully on my day job. The combination proved too unsustainable long-term.
##  Things to Consider Before Joining Turing
###**Weighing the Pros and Cons of Contractor Work**
For engineers considering Turing, it's important to realistically examine if the temporary contractor model truly fits your needs and lifestyle. Remote platforms like this trade some stability for higher pay and project variety. Make sure contract limitations won't negatively impact important needs like insurance coverage.
###**Patience Required During Matching Process**  
Prospective contractors also need patience, as finding a good client match can take weeks or even over a month depending on your skills and availability. Unlike full-time jobs, work is not guaranteed and engineers are only paid for hours billed to active projects.
###**Requiring Flexible Hours and Dedicated Capacity**
Turing also isn't practical if you can't adapt to occasional late nights or keep blocks of time free for projects without notice. Full availability and flexibility are musts to fully take advantage of opportunities. An already busy schedule won't sync well.
###**Consider Multiple Revenue Streams If Possible**  
For best sustainability, contractors should aim to balance platform work with other clients if possible. Relying on a single contract carries risks of being left with no income if it ends unexpectedly.
##  Overall Recommendations 
###**Definitely Worth a Try if Your Situation Aligns**
Overall, if engineers have the right lifestyle and availability to handle contractor limitations, I strongly recommend giving remote platforms like Turing a chance. The caliber of experience and career growth potential it provides can be truly invaluable. 
###**Understand Revenue Models Involve Profit Sharing**  
Just be aware that as a for-profit company, Turing's business model does mean they aim to generate income through their contractor matching and placement services. Their motivation is not purely altruistic help for engineers as a non-profit might operate. 
###**Potential for Smooth Experience and Great Career Boost**
However, if all criteria align - like having dedicated availability, flexibility with hours, and multi-country tax status - then contractors can have an immensely positive experience that accelerates skills and opens new doors. The right situation allows Turing'supsides far outweigh any disadvantages of their model.
