- **Choose your tattoos wisely**: If you decide to get tattoos, you should choose them wisely, considering the design, location, and visibility of your tattoos. You should avoid tattoos that are offensive, controversial, or inappropriate, such as those that depict violence, hate, or discrimination. You should also avoid tattoos that are too large, too many, or too conspicuous, such as those that cover your face, neck, or hands. You should opt for tattoos that are small, discreet, or easily concealed, such as those that are on your arms, legs, or torso.
- **Be prepared to compromise or sacrifice**: If you have tattoos, you should be prepared to compromise or sacrifice some aspects of your personal expression or professional goals. You may have to cover up your tattoos with clothing, makeup, or bandages, depending on the situation and the requirements of your job. You may also have to remove your tattoos with laser or surgery, if they interfere with your career advancement or performance.
