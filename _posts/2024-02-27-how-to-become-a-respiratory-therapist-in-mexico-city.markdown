Respiratory therapists (RTs) are healthcare professionals who specialize in treating patients with breathing problems, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or COVID-19. RTs work in various settings, such as hospitals, clinics, home care, or emergency services. They perform tasks such as administering oxygen, operating ventilators, performing chest physiotherapy, monitoring vital signs, and educating patients and families about respiratory care.
### Why Choose Mexico City as Your Destination?
Mexico City is one of the largest and most populous cities in the world, with over 21 million inhabitants. It is also a cultural, economic, and political hub of the country, offering a rich and diverse experience for visitors and residents alike. Mexico City has many attractions, such as historical monuments, museums, parks, restaurants, nightlife, and shopping.
However, Mexico City also faces some serious problems, such as air pollution, traffic congestion, crime, and poverty. These issues affect the health and well-being of the population, especially those who live in the outskirts of the city. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mexico City ranks among the most polluted cities in the world, with high levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These pollutants can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, or lung cancer.
Therefore, there is a high demand for respiratory therapists in Mexico City, as they can help improve the quality of life of patients with respiratory conditions. RTs are also needed to cope with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit Mexico hard, with over 2.5 million confirmed cases and over 200,000 deaths as of April 2021. RTs play a crucial role in managing patients with severe COVID-19, who require mechanical ventilation and intensive care.
